# Time Complexity Analysis for Subset Sum Problem (Backtracking)

## Algorithm Overview
The provided C code uses a backtracking approach to find all subsets of a given set of non-negative integers 'w' that sum up to a target value 'M'.

## Recursive Structure
The core function sumSubset(i, currSum, remSum) explores possibilities:
-   i: Index of the current element being considered.
-   currSum: Sum of elements chosen so far for the current subset.
-   remSum: Sum of all elements from index i to n-1 (remaining elements).

At each step i, the algorithm decides whether to include w[i] in the subset or not.

1.  **Include w[i]**: If currSum + w[i] <= M.
    -   Set x[i] = 1.
    -   Recurse: sumSubset(i + 1, currSum + w[i], remSum - w[i]).
2.  **Exclude w[i]**: (This branch is explored to find all solutions or if including w[i] doesn't lead to a solution from that path).
    -   Set x[i] = 0.
    -   Recurse: sumSubset(i + 1, currSum, remSum - w[i]).

## Base Cases and Pruning
-   If currSum == M: A valid subset is found. Print it.
-   If i == n (all elements processed) or currSum + remSum < M (cannot reach M even if all remaining elements are included): Prune this path and backtrack.

## Complexity Calculation
-   In the worst case, the algorithm explores a binary decision tree where each of the N elements can either be in a subset or not.
-   This leads to 2^N possible subsets to check.
-   For each subset, printing takes O(N) time.
-   The pruning (currSum + remSum < M) helps avoid exploring some branches, but the worst-case remains exponential.

## Resulting Complexity
-   **Time Complexity**: O(N * 2^N) if we consider printing time for all subsets. If we only consider the number of recursive calls, it's O(2^N). The provided C code prints, so O(N * 2^N) is more accurate if many solutions exist and are printed. Often, it's simplified to O(2^N) to describe the search space exploration.
-   **Space Complexity**: O(N) due to the recursion stack depth (at most N levels) and the x[] array of size N used to store the current subset composition.

Note: The Subset Sum problem is NP-complete. While this backtracking solution is exponential, pseudo-polynomial time solutions using dynamic programming exist (e.g., O(N*M)).
